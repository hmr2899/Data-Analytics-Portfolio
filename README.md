The project involved drawing inferences from 2 case studies, namely - Bank Marketing & Insurance.The concepts of Clustering, CART, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network are used to draw inferences from these case studies.

**Skills & Tools**: Clustering, CART, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks

The objective of the project is to predict whether a person makes over 50K a year given their demographic variations. To achieve this, several classification techniques are explored.

**Skills & Tools**: Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, CART.

The objective of the project is to predict loan default from a bank for 30,000 customers using kNN and a neural network and also perform segmentation on customers to see if default rates differ by age segment.

**Skills & Tools**: KNN, K-Means Clustering, Neural Network.

This project is based on 2 case-studies: Vote Prediction and Text Analysis. The 1st project is to predict which party a citizen is going to vote for on the basis of their age and according to the survey answers given by the citizens. The 2nd project is based on the analysis of the inaugural U.S.A. Presidential speeches. **Skills & Tools**: Text Mining Analytics, SVM - KNN - Naive Bayes, Ensemble Techniques, Logistic Regression - LDA
