The project is based on the trips made by Uber drivers. Different aspects of the trip are analyzed by using different functions in Python.

**Skills & Tools**: Python Functions, Data Interpretation, EDA

The project involved drawing inferences from 2 case studies, namely - Bank Marketing & Insurance. 

**Skills & Tools**: Clustering, CART, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks

The objective of the project is to predict whether a person makes over 50K a year given their demographic variations. To achieve this, several classification techniques are explored. In the end, random forest model yields to the best prediction result.

Objective of this project is to perform predictive assesment on the GDP of India through an inferential analysis of various socio-economic factors. Various models are compared and Stepwise Regression model is implemented which resulted in 5.7% Test MSE.

In this project I applied various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest and LightGBM to detect consumers who will default the loan. SMOTE is used to combat class imbalance and LightGBM is implemented that resulted into the highest accuracy 98.89% and 0.99 F1 Score.
