The project is based on the trips made by Uber drivers. Different aspects of the trip are analyzed by using different functions in Python.

 **Skills & Tools**: Python Functions, Data Interpretation, EDA

The project involved drawing inferences from 2 case studies, namely - Bank Marketing & Insurance. The concepts of Clustering, CART, Random Forest, ANN are used to draw inferences from these case studies. Various performance metrics have been used to validate the performance of predictions on Test & Train sets.
**Skills & Tools**: Clustering, CART, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks

A hybrid-filtering personalized news articles recommendation system which can suggest articles from popular news service providers based on reading history of twitter users who share similar interests (Collaborative filtering) and content similarity of the article and userâ€™s tweets (Content-based filtering).

In this project I have used models such as RNN, LSTM, 1D-CNN to predict the engine failure 50 cycles ahead of its time, and calculated feature importance from them using sensitivity analysis and shap values. Exponential degradation and similarity-based models are also used to calculate its remaining life.
