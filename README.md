The project is based on the trips made by Uber drivers. Different aspects of the trip are analyzed by using different functions in Python.

**Skills & Tools**: Python Functions, Data Interpretation, EDA

The project involved drawing inferences from 2 case studies, namely - Bank Marketing & Insurance.The concepts of Clustering, CART, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network are used to draw inferences from these case studies.

The objective of the project is to predict whether a person makes over 50K a year given their demographic variations. To achieve this, several classification techniques are explored. In the end, random forest model yields to the best prediction result.

In this project I have used models such as RNN, LSTM, 1D-CNN to predict the engine failure 50 cycles ahead of its time, and calculated feature importance from them using sensitivity analysis and shap values. Exponential degradation and similarity-based models are also used to calculate its remaining life.

In this project, I have employed regression techniques to estimate the Power curve of an on-shore Wind turbine. Nonlinear trees based regression methods perform best as true power curve is nonlinear. XGBoost is implemented and optimized using GridSearchCV which yields lowest Test RMSE-6.404.

Objective of this project is to identify the in-control data points and eliminate out of control data points to set up distribution parameters for manufacturing process monitoring. I utilized PCA for dimension reduction and Hotelling T2 and m-CUSUM control charts to established mean and variance matrices.

Objective of this project is to perform predictive assesment on the GDP of India through an inferential analysis of various socio-economic factors. Various models are compared and Stepwise Regression model is implemented which resulted in 5.7% Test MSE.

In this project I applied various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest and LightGBM to detect consumers who will default the loan. SMOTE is used to combat class imbalance and LightGBM is implemented that resulted into the highest accuracy 98.89% and 0.99 F1 Score.
